# Contribution Guide

## Contributing to the Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch with a meaningful name
3. Commit with a meaningful commit message that starts with a verb in simple present. Example:
    "update readme" and NOT "I have updated readme" or "Updating readme"
4. Push to your own fork 
5. Do a pull request to the original repo

### Remarks:
* Do not merge into master unless the code is running fine
* Do commit even if the code is not running perfectly at least once a day to a non master branch
* Use camelCase for variable names
* Write a comment block for every function you create that describes:
    * What the function does
    * What are its inputs
    * What are its outputs

## Contributing with Issues

* Write an issue for every single thing. This creates information for the upcoming users.

* When writing an issue, first put a filter. 
E.g. "[documentation] Guide line X describes a wrong use case"
    "[robot-arm] Robot arm gets stuck at 88 degress and cannot move to 90 degrees"
