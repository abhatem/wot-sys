## README

This is a Flask implementation to make a Dobot Magician on a sliding rail Web of Things compatible.

### Important Notes

- The pydobot library is included in this repository since its code is changed to adapt the sliding rail. 
Ideally, this should be submitted as a PR to the original repository.

- You should change the actions to match your own physical setup. This is programmed for ours and has predefined motion sequences

- If you do not have a TD directory, simply comment out `submit_td` function.
